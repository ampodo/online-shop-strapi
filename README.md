Online shop with functional cart and search modal. Built with react.js and strapi, the database is hosted on [https://render.com/](https://render.com/)

I used react-router-dom to switch between pages, from the single product page you can add the product item to the cart. The fully-responsive layout is adaptable for all screen sizes. For managing the state globally useContext hook was used.
