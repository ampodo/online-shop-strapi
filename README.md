Online shop with functional cart and search modal. Built with react.js and strapi, the database is hosted on https://render.com/

I used react-router-dom to switch between pages, from the single product page you can add the product item to the cart. The fully-responsive layout is adaptable for all screen sizes. For managing the state globally useContext hook was used. Stripe test integration is added to this project so checkout will be executed.

P.S. Loading of the application can take up to 30 seconds due to the free tier database.
