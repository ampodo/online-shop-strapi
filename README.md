Online shop with functional cart and search modal. Built with react.js and strapi, the database is hosted on https://render.com/ .
I used react-router-dom to switch between pages, from the single product page you can add the product item to the cart.
Fully-responsive layout is adaptable for all screen sizes. 
For managing the state globally useContext hook was used.
Stripe test integration is added to this project so checkout will be executed.
